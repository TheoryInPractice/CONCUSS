    Perform dynamic programming with a special table which keeps track
    of colors in bit vectors.

    By keeping track of colors, BVColorCount allows us to not have to
    look at smaller sets of colors.  This gets passed all the way back
    to the DecompGenerator, so the decompositions with fewer than p
    colors are never even created.  After processing all decompositions
    with one set of colors, we fill the counts found into a large table
    called totals.  If an entry of totals is already full, we don't
    change it; if it's 0, we can put our new count in.  When returning
    the final count, we simply add all the entries in totals.

    Combine counts like ColorCount, but smarter

    In HybridCount, we perform ColorCount-like dynamic programming to
    get counts for a few of the sets of colors.  We carefully choose
    which of these sets of colors we use so that all of the smaller
    sets are counted at least once (ideally exactly once).  For all of
    the other large sets of colors, we use the cheaper dynamic
    programming from InclusionExclusion.  We use the ColorCount to
    adjust the totals, but doing so is simpler than in InEx because
    the counts are mutually exclusive.

    Because we can't force a particular DecompGenerator, we could be
    seeing the sets of colors in any order.  This means we need to
    keep track of both types of count in parallel, then combine them
    together at the end.  For each set of colors on which we did
    InclusionExclusion-like dynamic programming, we subtract all the
    counts from its color subsets.  Then we add all those counts
    together with all the counts from ColorCount, and return the
    sum.

Software Citation
=================

If you use the CONCUSS software, you must cite:

M.P. O'Brien, C.G. Hobbs, K. Jasnick, F. Reidl, N.G. Rodrigues, and B.D. Sullivan. CONCUSS: Combatting Network Complexity Using Structural Sparsity v1.0, 2015.

This release will be assigned a DOI using Zenodo, which can be found in the repository's home (README.md) 
at https://github.com/theoryinpractice/CONCUSS. To the end of your bibliography entry, you should append 
DOI 10.xxx/zenodo.xxx (where x's are replaced with the current identifier).


If you use any of our published algorithms or heuristics you should *also*
cite the relevant paper(s) as directed below.

Pattern Counting (Subgraph Isomorphism) 
===========================================================

The methods in lib:pattern_counting (which are used in the main pipeline :program:`concuss.py`) implements the bounded-treedepth subgraph isomorphism algorithm described in:
